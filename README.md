# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments
The first assignment I did was and LED blink/fade 
project, I used the CircuitPython metro board 
to make an LED blink and then fade in and out

The next assignment I did was a servo assignment.
I basically just made a servo turn by touching 2
different wires which made it go in either 
direction, I set it to 180 degrees which ment it
went from one end of the servo to the other. 

The last assignment I did was I hooked up a button
and LCD screen to my metro board and then created a 
code that allows it to count up by one on the LCD
if the button is pressed. The most difficult part was 
trying to do it without an excessive use of time.sleep
