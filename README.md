**My CircuitPython assignments**


****LED Blink Fade****

***Objective*** 

The first assignment I did was and LED blink/fade
project, I used the CircuitPython metro board
to make an LED blink and then fade in and out

****Servo****

***Objective***

The next assignment I did was a servo assignment.
I basically just made a servo turn by touching 2
different wires which made it go in either
direction, I set it to 180 degrees which ment it
went from one end of the servo to the other.

****LCD Screen and botton****

***Objective***

The last assignment I did was I hooked up a button
and LCD screen to my metro board and then created a
code that allows it to count up by one on the LCD
if the button is pressed. The most difficult part was
trying to do it without an excessive use of time.sleep

****Photo Interupter****

***Objective***

In this assignment I used a photo interupter to print the
number of interupts o nthe srial monitor. It was a bit
difficult to not get it to just print out random interupt
numbers.

In this assignment we used an ultrasonic sensor in orde
to change the RGB led light on the metro bored from 
red to green while, displaying all the colors in between 
the too like, blu, teal, purple, etc. 

****Fancy RGB LED****

***Objective***

The purpose of this assigment was to use 2 rgb leds and 
display all the colors of the rainbow in order, and then 
create a color shift rainbow sequence with the same led

getting the leds to work)
